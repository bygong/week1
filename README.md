# Week 1

An introduction to HTML5, CSS3, and Ruby.

Fork this repository so that I can capture your GitHub username.  If you

Then, get this code by cloning it or downloading a zip file.

### HTML5 and CSS3

There are lots of good resources on the web. Feel free to Google.  I like http://www.w3schools.com for reference, as well as https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/.

I'll probably be using the Bootstrap CSS framework to make it easier to visually style the apps that we write in class. See the [Bootstrap Grid Cheat Sheet](bootstrap.md) in this repository.

### How to run Ruby scripts

From your command line:

```
ruby {filename}
```

You can also use the `irb` interactive utility to run Ruby expressions one at a time.


### Cheat Sheet: Ruby Data Containers

The two main containers we will use in this class are `Array` and `Hash`.

Links to official documentation:
- http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html
- http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Hash.html
- http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/String.html


For arrays, the most common methods are:

-  `.first`
-  `.last`
-  `.count`
-  `.size`
-  `.each`
-  `.select`
-  `.map`
-  `.empty?`
-  `.any?`
-  `.shuffle`
-  `.sample`
-  `.sort`
-  `.sort_by`

For hashes:

- `.keys`
- `.values`
